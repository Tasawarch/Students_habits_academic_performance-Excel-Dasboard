**Project Name: Students Habits & Academic Performance Analysis (Excel)**

**Description:**
This project focuses on analyzing how students’ lifestyle habits and backgrounds influence their academic performance. Using Microsoft Excel, I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and created interactive dashboards with pivot tables and slicers to identify key insights and correlations.

**Key Steps & Tasks:**

**Data Cleaning & Preparation:**

Removed duplicate entries

Handled missing values and formatted columns for consistency

Ensured numerical and categorical data accuracy

**Exploratory Analysis using Pivot Tables:**

Gender vs Scores — compared average scores between male and female students

Study Hours vs Scores — analyzed relationship between study time and academic results

Parental Education vs Scores — measured impact of parental education level on student performance

Part-Time Job vs Scores — evaluated how working part-time affects scores

Age Group & Gender vs Scores — studied performance trends across age and gender groups

**Interactive Dashboard:**

Added Slicers for Age, Gender, and Part-Time Job filters

Designed a clean, easy-to-use layout for educators and analysts to explore patterns visually
**Tools Used:**
Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts)

Data Cleaning & Transformation

**Outcome:**
Identified meaningful correlations between study habits, parental education, and student scores—helping educators understand which factors contribute most to academic success.
